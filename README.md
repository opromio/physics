### Repository with some of the code done during college

Here you will find mostly Python and Fortran code. Requirements will be indicated in each folder but already note that
all Fortran code is in v77. In Python, you may find 2.7 or >= 3.5 depending on the project.
Inside each folder, you should find a more detailed Readme with the requirements to run the code.
